# Intro

- Just an ordinary person with loads of extraordinary dreams.

# Introduction

At Swift, I'm currently at the forefront of application and systems support, leveraging my academic background in Human Neuroscience to enhance operational efficiency. My role within the Core Messaging Team is instrumental in maintaining robust production operations. With a Bachelor's degree from the prestigious University of Birmingham, I bring a unique perspective to the technical realm.

My proficiencies in data science are not just theoretical; they're tried and tested in research at The Chinese University of Hong Kong. Here, I apply data analysis rigorously, transforming complex datasets into actionable insights. My certifications in fMRI and neuroimaging principles, aligned with my role, reflect my dedication to bridging technology and neuroscience.
